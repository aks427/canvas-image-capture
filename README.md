# canvas-image-capture

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aks427/canvas-image-capture.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aks427/canvas-image-capture)

## Introduction

This library enables capturing and resizing images using `<canvas>`, `FileReader` and `ImageCapture`. This is browser only and won't work for Node.js.

The goal of this library:
* Preview thumbnail
* Resize image
* Take picture (where `ImageCapture` is supported)
* Generate data for image upload
* Handle exif data - maybe
